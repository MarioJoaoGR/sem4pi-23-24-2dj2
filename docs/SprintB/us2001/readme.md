# US 1000a

## 1. Context

This task, identified as "US 2001", is being assigned for the first time. The context for this task is continuously
process the files produced by the Applications Email Bot, so that they can be imported into the system by initiative of
the Operator.

## 2. Requirements

**US 2001** As Product Owner, I want the system to, is continuously
process the files produced by the Applications Email Bot, so that they can be imported into the system by initiative of
the Operator.

**Dependencies/References:**

- NFR12(SCOMP) The base solution for the upload of files must be implemented following specific technical requirements
  such as the use of the C programming language with
  processes, signals and pipes. Specific requirements will be provided in SCOMP.

## 3. Analysis

## Client Meeting

- A lot of questions for “a single question”. As stated in your question, the system should be kept in a consistent
  state. Regarding duplicate files, there should not be any duplicate files (why would duplicate files exist?).
  Regarding the report, there can be multiple report files, each one uniquely identified by some sort of timestamp.
- Não está definido um número máximo, mas podem estabelecer um limite a configurar, por exemplo, num ficheiro de
  configuração contendo um limite em tamanho (Mb) ou em número de anexos.
- I am not a technical person, but I should say that the report should include information that is enough for
  diagnosing problems in the import. I think some form of configuration of detail to be reported should be interesting,
  like what is usually available for log files, with a default rule for maximum detail.
- Penso que o documento que refere não é do documento principal de especificação do sistema, será um documento
  complementar com especificação especifica de uma unidade curricular. Sendo assim, penso que devem esclarecer a questão
  noutra fonte. Mas, sem querer condicionar a reposta “oficial” (que não é esta), penso que seja uma opção, e que cada
  solução pode considerar qual a que segue.
- Como product owner não tenho requisitos especificos sobre esse aspeto. Espero apenas que o Sistema mantenha sempre a
  integridade dos dados estes não sejam “perdidos”.

## Business Rules

- This US is directly related to the system.
- Process the files produced by the Applications Email Bot is an automated process .
- The files must be processed so that they can lately be imported by the operator into the system.

## 6. Integration/Demonstration

### Integration

We seamlessly integrated our functionality by leveraging an existing service that included both a repository and a
controller. This approach allowed us to efficiently integrate our solution into the system without duplicating efforts
or reinventing existing components.

### Demonstration

Since this funcitonality is a background process, there isn't a way to demonstrate it directly. 

## 7. Observations

- Nothing to add.
